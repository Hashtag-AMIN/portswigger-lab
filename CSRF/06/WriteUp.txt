In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
- A relevant action: change a users email
- Cookie-based session handling: session cookie
- No unpredictable request parameters 

Testing CSRF Tokens:
1. Remove the CSRF token and see if application accepts request
2. Change the request method from POST to GET
3. See if csrf token is tied to user session

Testing CSRF Tokens and CSRF cookies:
1. Check if the CSRF token is tied to the CSRF cookie
   - Submit an invalid CSRF token
   - Submit a valid CSRF token from another user
2. Submit valid CSRF token and cookie from another user


In order to exploit this vulnerability, we need to perform 2 things:
1. Inject a csrf cookie in the user's session (HTTP Header injection) - satisfied
2. Send a CSRF attack to the victim with a known csrf token
