

if send 3 req and username & password is incorrect you will ban
But if you send a true credential this protection will be reset and can brute force your password

so make list of username & password with python script then use that list with intruder & pickfork option

remember you can use macro option in burp

curl -ik -X $'POST' \
    -b $'session=022k1FGFhI3zjmoJVWF3EzTAPLybDgHf' \
    --data-binary $'username=carlos&password=computer' \
    $'https://0a5f00f8039f9b7a82a6b52a00c200ec.web-security-academy.net/login'
	
then we can find true credential

and don't forget config resource pool to send 1 req
